## Executive Summary
This project demonstrates a professional-grade DevOps workflow for a Flask-based application, integrating environment-based configuration, containerization, database management, CI/CD automation, and preparation for Kubernetes deployment. The documentation provides a clear overview, versioning history, and a roadmap for future enhancements.

---

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to create a fully documented, containerized Flask application that showcases modern DevOps practices and is ready for demonstration, testing, and GitHub repository presentation.

---

## Objective of the Project
1. Develop a Flask application following modern development best practices.  
2. Integrate a Postgres database with proper migrations.  
3. Implement environment-specific configuration management.  
4. Containerize the application and database using Docker.  
5. Demonstrate CI/CD pipeline automation with GitHub Actions.  
6. Prepare the application for Kubernetes deployment.  
7. Maintain professional documentation suitable for GitHub and demos.

## Project Overview
**Architecture:**

**Development Environment:**  
- Flask App Container + Postgres DB Container
- Database initialization script (`create_db.py`) to quickly create the database schema 
  locally using SQLAlchemy models.  
  - Usage: `python create_db.py`  
  - Respects environment configuration (development, testing) via `config.py`  

**Production Environment (Planned):**  
- Flask App Container + Database managed by AWS RDS / Managed Service

**Project Snapshot Highlights:**  
- Flask app using Factory pattern and Blueprints  
- Centralized configuration via .env and config.py  
- Database integration with Postgres & Alembic migrations  
- Dockerized development environment  
- Hot reload & API testing via curl

## Tools and Technologies
| Category | Tool/Technology | Purpose |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| Backend | Python 3.11, Flask | Application development |
| Database | Postgres, Alembic | Database management & migrations |
| Containerization | Docker, docker-compose | Dev & prod environment setup |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Pipeline automation (push to GHCR, deploy) |
| Cloud / Future | AWS RDS, EC2, S3 | Production-ready services |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform | Planned automation |
| Monitoring | Grafana, Prometheus | Planned observability |
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, Jinja | Templates & UI rendering |

## Versioning and Milestones
> Version 1.0 reflects the current finalized state of the Flask DevOps Portfolio as of 30-08-2025. The following table captures the key milestones leading to this version. Note that the period between 08-08-2025 and 28-08-2025 was primarily used for environment experimentation, learning, and preparatory work before formal Dockerization and containerization. These steps are essential in real-world DevOps workflows, even if no formal milestone was completed during that period.

| Date (DD-MM-YYYY) | Feature / Milestone | Tools/Techniques | Status |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| 06-08-2025 | Flask project setup & basic app | Flask, Python | Completed |
| 08-08-2025 | Environment configuration | .env, config.py | Completed |
| 28-08-2025 | Dockerfile for Flask App | Docker | Completed |
| 29-08-2025 | Docker-compose dev DB setup | Docker Compose, Postgres | Completed |
| 30-08-2025 | Hot reload, curl API testing | Flask debug, curl | Completed |
| Future | Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, Grafana, Prometheus | Planned | Planned |

## Achievements, Current Progress, and Future Enhancements
**Achievements:**  
- Flask app development completed  
- DB integration & migration folders created  
- Dockerized DB container with persistent volume  
- Environment management centralized via config.py

**Current Progress:**  
- Flask containerization validation pending  
- models.py creation pending  
- CI/CD pipeline planning in progress

**Future Enhancements:**  
- Full Dockerization of Flask container & production setup  
- Kubernetes deployment & scaling  
- Automated CI/CD with testing & deployment pipelines (push images to GHCR)  
- Monitoring & observability (Grafana, Prometheus)  
- Infrastructure automation via Terraform

---

## Project Status
**Summary Paragraph:**  
> Project is in an advanced development stage. Core Flask app development, database integration, and partial Dockerization are complete. Next steps include Flask container validation, CI/CD implementation (with GHCR), and Kubernetes readiness. Documentation is being finalized for professional presentation and GitHub repository showcase.

**Tabular Status Summary:**
| Component | Status | Notes / Next Steps |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Flask App | Developed | Containerization pending |
| Database | Integrated, migrations created | Postgres persistent volume ready |
| Dockerization | DB container completed | Flask App container pending |
| CI/CD | Planning stage | GitHub Actions setup upcoming (images pushed to GHCR) |
| Future Enhancements | Planned | Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, Grafana, Prometheus |

---

## Future Roadmap
- Kubernetes pod deployment & scaling  
- AWS-managed services (RDS, EC2, S3 deployment)  
- CI/CD automation & testing (push Docker images to GHCR)  
- Monitoring & observability: Grafana, Prometheus  
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform  
- Continuous documentation updates as new tools/features are added
